Model description :

The Brownian motion models for financial markets are based on
the work ofRobert C. Merton and Paul A. Samuelson, as extensions
to the one-period market models of Harold Markowitz and William
F. Sharpe, and are concerned with defining the concepts of
financial assets and markets, portfolios, gains and wealth in
terms of continuous-time stochastic processes.
