Model description :

Brownian motion progression. We developed a model based on what learned
on the first part of the class of Fixed Income and we therefore developed
a little algorithm that perform a Brownian motion based on the Weiner process.
Since this is one of the main used methods in finance to simulate the path of
a stock, we decided to adopt it as our base model as it is based on a random process.
