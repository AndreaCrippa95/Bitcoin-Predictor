Model description :

Support Vector Regressor. Given a set of training examples, each
marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training
algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category
or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.
SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the
width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then
mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category
based on which side of the gap they fall. In addition to performing
linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear
classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping
their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
